# Welcome to my second project!

Here I have created a memory game which is suitable for everyone. The aim of the game is to attract casual players, who wish to have an enjoyable and fun experience. 

This game intends to have no competition as it is simply there for people to play when they are bored or when then have a spare 5/10 mins on their lunch break at work. The sports nature is incorporated within the selection of music to make it relaxing yet uplifting and positive.  Please Enjoy ðŸ˜ƒ

## Features
The game consists of one page only, however has Modals that pop up when clicked or when the game is over. 

![Logo-header](assets/documentation/logoHeader-and-gameButtons.png)

The top of the game contains the game Logo along with the game name. The icons below that all have hover effects to ensure the user knows that they are about to click on that icon. The left icon resets the full game, the question mark produces a how to play modal and the sound icon allows the user the play music. 

![Play-Modal](assets/documentation/play-modal.png)

The how to play Modal is a simple design which has a title explaining what this modal is and step by step instructions. Next to the title is a close icon which when hovered turns red; again enforcing to the user this is being selected.

![Game-Stats](assets/documentation/game-stats.png)

This section of the game shows the current time of the round, the current moves and the last time the user got. The current time does have a slight delay when counting up however. The total moves increments by one when the user has flipped over 2 cards which would signify 1 go. The last time saves the users previous round.

![Memory-Game](assets/documentation/memory-game.png)

The memory game itself is a 4 by 4 sqaure with cards evenly seperated. The cards hve a border and rounded edges to resemble a card style as sort. The cards also have a hover effect again reiterating to the user they are slecting that particular card. When the card has been clicked it has a depress animation. The cards will then 'flip'with a audio cue to make it sound realistic.

![Matched](assets/documentation/matched-cards.png)

Matched cards are kept visible on the board to help users with knowing which card has correctly been identified. All cards face value have a white background with a character playing a certain sport. It was important to keep the background white and use similar characters to make the game a little more challenging based on the size of the game.

![Footer](assets/documentation/footer.png)

A very simple footer with an external link to my main Git Hub page. Link has the same hover effect as the game Info section and the page is opened in an external tab.

![Win-Modal](assets/documentation/win-modal.png)

Finally, once the user has successfully matched all 16 cards a win modal will be presented. The background audio (if selected by the user) will stop and a congrats style audio will play. The modal again is very simplistic with a trophy that 'shakes' left to right and this will do this until the user clicks off the modal. There is a play again button which will reload the game. Again the button has a simple hover effect.

### Audio

As mentioned throughout the features section there are 4 pieces of audio within the game. The background music which is chilled but also upbeat; a flip effect, a match noise which will enforce to the user two cards have successfully matched and finally the winning audio.

## Colours

My game has three main clours present throughout the site; Green, white and black. The green background has a linear gradient effect which takes the shade of green from lighter to darker. I feel this makes it more attractive than simplying having 1 shade of green but not too distracting from the main purpose which is the game. I have used black and white as has a very good contrast. 

## Font

The font I selcted was Architects Daughter from Google fonts with a backup of cursive. I really liked the font as it was quite funky but still kept its readability; perfect for a game environment.

## Validators
![HTML](assets/documentation/html-validator.png)
** Final validator result above.
* Initially I had only a small number of errors within my HTML. Some were due to not closing body tag and one was a missues of 'type'.

![CSS](assets/documentation/css-validator.png)
** Final validator result above
* One error within CSS validator was from using more than one argument within margin-top.

![JavaScript](assets/documentation/css-validator.png)
** Final validator result above
* My JavaScript validatior didnt throw up any errors however there was warnings in regards to missing semi-colons which was resolved.
* I also included a return before my ternary operator.
* There are still three warnings left; however I have tried resolving this issue with no luck without causing my game to break.

## Solved bugs and errors
1. Selecting more than two cards in one move 
    - Solved issue by adding locked board to unmatched cards solved this issue
2. Timer starting after 2 card flip
   - For this I had to create three variables which was stall, start and end. This as mentioned before has causing warning however it allowed my timer to be set after first card flip.(Still slight delay)  
3. The structure of cards wasnt centred for larger screens
   - This issue was resolved by having to add a padding right of 100px. This then centered my game.  
4. Following on from the above error structure of game below 700px became distorted

   - Had to remove all padding right for game structure below this width and reduce size of board.
5. Issue saving local storage within last time ID
   - i as initially trying to use a Query selector but for some reason this would then stop my cards from being able to flip. I researched Jquery to see if this would sort this issue and it did with no errors.

## Unsolved bugs and errors
* Issue with timer as mentioned earlier; I have managed to ensure the timer starts on the first card flip however still a slight delay in counting up.
* Initially wanted a welcome modal/text overlay; The modal would constantly freeze and produce lots of errors when making amendments in my code so this had to be removed.

## Linking To User Stories

`As a user I want the game to be fun`:

* The memory game I feel is very fun to play. The board layout constantly changes meaning the cards arent in the same place

`As a user I want it to be easy to navigate`:

* Very simplistic design with three main buttons and a footer. Icons enlarge and change colour to signify it will do something. When we are taken to how to play modal a simple 'X' in top right corner to get out of that modal.

`As a user I want a game that is relaxing`:

* I have used relaxing background music which also is quite uplifting. There is no competitive feel about the game as i Havent including a count down timer. It is simply a game which you can play to take your mind off things.

`As a user I want the game to be eyecatching`:

* I have used a very eye catching green with a linear effect which is attractive yet subtle. The cards themselves have a card feel about them in the sense the back is 'busy' but the front is too the point and easy to read.

`As a user I want the audio to be relevant and enjoyable`:

* As mentioned earlier the game has relaxing background music which can be turned off if not needed. The flip and match effects are quick, not too loud but fit in with the card game. The winner audio too is only short but signifys the user has beat the game.

## Developments
As I progress within JavaScript this game is something I would like to come back to and develop. Some ideas I want going forward is to increase the number of cards via a difficulty button. To add a leaderboard system that will contain all the best 10 scores. A welcome modal that allows you to view the above (levels/leaderboard).
