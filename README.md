# Welcome to my second project!

Here I have created a memory game which is suitable for everyone. The aim of the game is to attract casual players, who wish to have an enjoyable and fun experience. 

This game intends to have no competition as it is simply there for people to play when they are bored or when then have a spare 5/10 mins on their lunch break at work. The sports nature is incorporated within the selection of music to make it relaxing yet uplifting and positive.  Please Enjoy ðŸ˜ƒ
